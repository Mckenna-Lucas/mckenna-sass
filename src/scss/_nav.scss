// also I SWEAR to you that I got the freaking underline while hovering to work, but for some reason 

// #l-link {
//   color: $primary-color;
//   text-decoration: none;
// }

// I honestly don't know how to seperate the links. When I did b:link, it imediatley changed to the seocndary color (rn the content link is blending into the primary color.. like the link is there but it's blending into the primary color. I could just change the color of the links all together, but that would just defeat the whole point of learning how to separate them. Also when I did b:link-- my freaking cs hover feature stopped working.

// b:link {
  //color: $secondary-color;
  //text-decoration: underline;
//}

//b:visited {
  //color: $secondary-color;
  //text-decoration: none;
//}


//b:hover {
  //text-decoration: none;
//}

// #l-link {
//   color: $primary-color;
//   text-decoration: none;
// }
